Curve
---

Curve is an open-source tool to help label anomalies on time-series data. The labeled data (also known as the ground truth) is necessary for evaluating time-series anomaly detection methods. Otherwise, one can not easily choose a detection method, or say method A is better than method B. The labeled data can also be used as the training set if one wants to develop supervised learning methods for detection.

Curve is designed to support plugins, so one can equip Curve with customized and powerful functions to help label effectively. For example, a plugin to identify anomalies which are similar to the one you labeled, so you don't have to search them through all the data.

Curve is originally developed by Baidu and Tsinghua NetMan Lab. [click for preview](http://curve.baidu.com/web/index.html)

## Getting Started

### To build the docker deployment container
```bash
docker build --tag curve .
```
### To build the docker development container
```bash
docker build --tag curve-dev .
```

### To run depolyment container
```bash
docker run -p 8890:8080 -it curve 
```

### To run development container
```bash
docker run -v $(pwd)/Curve:/root/Curve -p 8890:8080 -it curve-dev /bin/bash
```
### Run and stop

Simply use control.sh to start or stop Curve.

```bash
# ./control.sh start
# ./control.sh stop
```
Server will blind 8080 by default, you can change it in `./api/uwsgi.ini`.

> The first start will take a while because of the compilation. 
> If you pull updates from github, Rebuild will be triggered during start or reload.

### Data format

You can load a CSV file into Curve. The CSV should have the following format

* First column is the timestamp
* Second column is the value
* Third column (optional) is the label. 0 for normal and 1 for abnormal.

The header of CSV is optinal, like `timestamp,value,label`.  

Some examples of valid CSV

* With a header and the label column

|timestamp|value|label|
|---|---|---|
|1476460800|2566.35|0|
|1476460860|2704.65|0|
|1476460920|2700.05|0|


* Without the header
 
|1476460800|2566.35|0|
|---|---|---|
|1476460860|2704.65|0|
|1476460920|2700.05|0|

* Without the header and the label colum

|1476460800|2566.35|
|---|---|
|1476460860|2704.65|
|1476460920|2700.05|

* Timestamp in human-readable format

|20161015000000|2566.35|
|---|---|
|20161015000100|2704.65|
|20161015000200|2700.05|
